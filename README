h1. Cuploadify Plugin

Cuploadify is the CakePHP plugin for Uploadify.

h2. Background

In my attempt to decouple all of my CakePHP projects into separate, reusable plugins, I’ve created a CakePHP plugin for Uploadify. For those of you who aren’t familiar with Uploadify, they describe themselves as "a powerful and highly-customizable file upload script."

h2. Requirements

* PHP 5.0
* CakePHP 1.3
* Uploadify 2.1.4 (included)
* JQuery 1.4.4 (included but can use your existing copy)

h2. Installation

_[Manual]_

# Download this: http://github.com/achan/cuploadify/zipball/master
# Unzip that download.
# Copy the resulting folder to app/plugins
# Rename the folder you just copied to @cuploadify@

_[GIT Submodule]_

In your app directory type:
<pre><code>git submodule add git://github.com/achan/cuploadify.git plugins/cuploadify
git submodule init
git submodule update
</code></pre>

_[GIT Clone]_

In your plugin directory type
<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/achan/cuploadify.git cuploadify</code></pre>

h2. Usage

Usage examples and further documentation can be found at http://www.am05.com/tag/cuploadify. You can also check out http://localhost/cuploadify/tests/upload to verify that your plugin has been successfully installed.


h2. Todo

* Update to Uploadify 3.0.0
